                    Throughout Quincy Hilliard’s life, he has composed over 250 different pieces of music. However, it is unfair to just label him as only a composer because he is also a conductor, an author, and a professor. Hilliard stands out among other composers due to his involvement in every aspect of music production. The first half of creating music is composition. He has over 54 years of experience composing various works for wind orchestras. He got his Ph.D. at the University of Florida in music theory and composition, making him more than qualified to compose. During his time as an accomplished composer, Hilliard achieved many awards, such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers awards on nine separate occasions. The other half of music creation is the performance or execution of the composition. Hilliard also excels in this aspect, as he has earned a masters and bachelors degree in music education at Arkansas State University and Mississippi State University, respectively. This translated into his conducting career through being the bandmaster of the Iowa Middle School Honor Band and frequently guest conducting at major university bands. This has earned him several awards as well, such as the National Bandmasters Association Citation of Excellence Award. Being a great conductor complements Hilliard’s main career as a composer, since understanding how to conduct a band translates well into creating a composition proficiently. Quincy Hilliard’s experience in creating enjoyable compositions to listen to and play is why he will continue to make ripples throughout the music world.

                        A piece of music is worthless if it cannot tell a story and sway the emotions of its audience. What makes a composition great is its ability to temporarily bring the listener into its world to live through and feel an experience. Quincy Hilliard’s music does exactly this through his approach to programmatic storytelling. He aims to convey his multiple messages through the medium of wind music. For example, in the composition “As the World Watched”, the story of the bombing of the Birmingham church in 1964 was beautifully translated onto the music sheets. On top of a historical war story, he also incorporates his emotions into current events like the shooting of Parkland High School. Even an amateur in musical theory can analyze and decipher the first few layers of this piece. From creating a nauseating feel with the use of offset trombones to a sense of hope with a calming flute melody. Another example is his piece “Ghost Dance", which tells the events of the Wounded Knee Massacre of Indigenous people that occurred in 1890. In this piece, Hilliard creatively uses haunting chants to communicate the traditions of Indigenous people and their suffering during the late 1800s. As a scholar of Aaron Copland, Hilliard intends to tell the stories that Copland was telling three-quarters of a century ago in a layered context. The piece “Fanfare for Freedom” incorporates the first section from Copland’s “Fanfare of the Common Man." During this piece, strong brass was used to recreate the same triumphant and monumental feelings of “Fanfare of the Common Man”. However, Hilliard alters the piece to sound more driven and unwavering, as a soldier would when he fights for freedom. This is how he can transform and tell a story with each composition he creates. Hilliard presents his ideas in a developed manner to create a cohesive and immersive experience for the audience. Through his storytelling, Quincy Hilliard conveys thoughts and emotions that no word on a page can.

                        Quincy Hilliard’s history as a composer and music educator has garnered him massive influence in the music world. A composition is truly successful if it manages to reach the hearts of many, uniting people across the world. Hilliard’s career as a professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette has allowed him to pass on his knowledge of music theory and composition to many young aspiring musicians and composers. Dr.Hilliard is also able to extract new perspectives from his students, enhancing his own compositions. His position as a professor also prompted him to author many educational books, such as Theory Concepts, his duology on music theory. On top of providing theoretical resources for the incoming musicians, he also writes practical exercises, with Scales and Tuning Exercises for Superior Bands being a relatively recent addition to his collection. His influence on music ensures the emergence of musicians for the next generation. However, his reach does not just end in the world of music but also extends to outside industries. In 1996, Hilliard was commissioned to compose his work “Anthem for Victory'' for that year’s Olympic Games in Atlanta. Furthermore, he also scored for the documentary film, Texas Rangers. His involvement in these compositions shows that his art of music can be brought into the sports and movie worlds as well. The hard work that is required to create such a large influence should be required of every great composer. Therefore, Quincy Hilliard will live to be an inspiration for all musicians following in his footsteps.
